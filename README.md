# DocumentStore

DocumentStore is a Java library that mimics a simple search engine.
This project was completed as part of a Data Structures course taught at my University.

## Build
I created a pom.xml file that can easily be pulled and used. The code was compiled for Java 11.

## Testing

I use the JUnit-4.12 test suite to test the DocumentStore's functionallity
